mySharedLSLScripts is just a collection of unrelated LSL scripts that I have
written and I wish to share.
All these scripts are licensed under GPL v3.
Pay attention, most of these scripts are just working ideas, made mostly
to satisfy my curiosity, to learn and to understand than to fulfill any
"production" requirements.
If you wish to use one or more of them in a production environment I am pretty
confident you have to heavy work on them...
